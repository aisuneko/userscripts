...for a bunch of weird purposes. Also for playing around with JavaScript. 

Currently includes:

- **RedirectChineseWikipedia** (part of RedirectWikipedia): Force redirection of Chinese Wikipedia from other locales (zh-tw, zh-hk, zh-sg...) to zh-cn. Also redirects from mobile site to desktop site. (**Known issue: mobile sites of different locales will be redirected twice**)
- **RedirectMobileWikipedia** (part of RedirectWikipedia): A simpler and more straightforward fork of the above script. Redirects Wikipedia (in any languages) from mobile site to desktop site. Inspired by @Moe23333's fork of this repo. 
- **osu!backgrounddl**: Downloader for the background images in osu! beatmaps, accessed through a button on the beatmap info page (~~though I simply cloned the Favorites button on the left and tweaked it.~~) Uses [beatconnect.io](https://beatconnect.io)'s background API.

\* Any ideas or suggestions on optimizing them are appreciated.
